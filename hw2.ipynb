    "(Bayesian): A new credit scoring system has been developed to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The system has a 90% sensitivity, meaning that it correctly identifies 90% of those who will default on their loans. It also has a 95% specificity, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of those who will not default. The default rate among borrowers is 2%. Given these prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity estimates, what is the probability that a borrower flagged by the system as likely to default will actually default? If the average loss per defaulted loan is $200,000 and the cost to run the credit scoring test on each borrower is $500, what is the total first-year cost for evaluating 10,000 borrowers?"
